<h2>Setup Steps</h2>
  <p>Out the box this app contains an <a href="../../manager/jmx_cf/data/inputs/jmx">example JMX modular input</a>. Before you enable this input , you should first edit the example 
    configuration file at <b>SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/jmx_cf/bin/config/config.xml</b> to point to your target JVM. Also be sure that your target JVM is correctly setup to expose it's JMX Agent.</p> 

<h2>Search the incoming data</h2>

  <p> Once you have a basic setup configured and enabled, you can then <a href="../../app/search/search?q=search%20index%3Djmx%20sourcetype%3Djmx">search</a> your JMX data.With data now coming in , the example dashboards should start populating with data.Just browse to them via the Navigation bar above.</p> 

<h2>Look for errors</h2>

  <p>Any errors get written to Splunk's own internal logs which you can <a href="../../app/search/search?q=search%20index%3D_internal%20component%3DExecProcessor%20jmx.py">easily search over</a>.There is also <a href="../../app/jmx_cf/jmx_connectivity_errors">a dashboard</a> accesible via the above Navigation bar that reports on connectivity errors.</p> 

<h2>Don't need the example dashboards ?</h2>

<p>The Simple XML dashboards that are part of this app are purely examples of visualizing a subset of the available java.lang domain MBean attributes.
    In all likelihood , you'll mostly be interested in just deploying the JMX Modular Input component of this app for collecting JMX data from your JVM landscape and then 
    searching over and visualizing this data in a proprietary manner.
  Simply just remove the <b>SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/jmx_cf/default/data/ui/nav</b> and  <b>SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/jmx_cf/default/data/ui/views</b> directorys if you don't require them.
